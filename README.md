**d3d9hook** is a Direct3D 9 hook that intercepts and modifies Direct3D functions. It makes player models visible through walls using stripes in games like **Counter-Strike: Global Offensive** and **Counter-Strike: Source**.
The focus was to allow the same DLL to be injected into both games without needing recompilation.

## **Features**

- **Hook Direct3D 9 functions.**
- **Intercept and tweak rendering calls.**
- **Example of custom rendering in Direct3D 9 games to make player models visible through walls.**

**This project is not in active development. It was made for learning purposes.**
